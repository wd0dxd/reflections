What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Metafiles used for tracking the repository are created in a new folder named .git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files that you want to track.  When you commit, git writes the changes to the working directory.
